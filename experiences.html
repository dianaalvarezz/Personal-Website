                        <p>My debut research presentation at the CURE symposium in Spring 2022 at Northern Illinois University marked a pivotal moment in my academic journey.
                        CURE, an esteemed platform for undergraduate research, allowed me to present my work under the guidance of Dr. Melissa Clucas Walter. Our project,
                        titled 'Do Parent Education Programs Increase Early Language Interactions in DeKalb County?', examined the impact of two community programs on 
                        enhancing early language interactions. This research was particularly challenging as it was in its nascent stages, with recruitment issues for the
                        LENA Start program, a new initiative in DeKalb County. Our goal was ambitious â€“ to involve 20 parent-child dyads, with children aged 0-36 months living
                        at or below 185% of the Federal Poverty Level in DeKalb County. Although the project was not complete at the time of the presentation, this experience
                        was invaluable. It taught me the nuances of conducting and presenting research, especially in its preliminary stages. I honed my skills in data analysis,
                        problem-solving, and adapting to unforeseen challenges. Most importantly, presenting at CURE bolstered my confidence in public speaking and reinforced my
                        passion for research. This experience was not just about sharing our findings; it was a journey of personal and professional growth, learning to navigate
                        the complexities of real-world research and effectively communicate its significance.</p>

            <h3>London, England (Winter 2023 - 2024)</h3>
                <div class="image-section">
                    <p>During the winter break of 2023-2024, I engaged in a study abroad program in London, centered around public health. This program, intriguingly
                    different from my computer science major, tapped into my previous healthcare interests and provided a comprehensive view of the National Health
                    Service (NHS). Beyond academic learning, the experience was enriched by London's status as a tech hub, allowing me to explore its famous science 
                    museums and technological innovations. This journey offered more than just educational enrichment; it was a deep dive into the culture, technology,

                <div class="image-section">
                    <p>Diving into a new world, my four-week study abroad experience in Barcelona with CIEE was a leap into cultural and 
                    personal discovery. Living with a local family, I savored authentic Spanish life, from homemade paella to lively conversations 
                    in Spanish, a language familiar yet freshly challenging in this new context. My marketing class wasn't just about theories; it 
                    was a lens into Spain's vibrant business culture, blending classroom learning with the city's dynamic streets. Every 
                    cobblestone in Barcelona told a story, from GaudÃ­'s architectural wonders to the buzz of beachside markets. This journey 
                    was my first solo flight beyond home borders, transforming initial fears into a newfound independence and a broader 
                    perspective of the world. Barcelona didn't just teach me; it changed me.</p>

            <h3>Daily Diary Thing</h3>
                <div class="image-section">
                    <p>The purpose of this study is to measure the prevalence of mobile device usage of parents of young children and to explore the impact of
                    mobile device usage on the quality of the childâ€™s home language environment. This will require collecting data from both child and parent. We
                    know that the more a child is exposed to an environment rich with language, the more a child's brain develops. This is because environments
                    rich with language promote more conversational turns, which are non-cry sounds made by the child after being spoken to, which will then lead
                    to more brain development. Conversational turns will be measured through the usage of recorded vest that will be worn by the child throughout
                    their daily activities, which will record language sounds spoken to the child and by the child. The data collected from the recorder vest will
                    then be processed into daily data charts which are ready for analysis. On the parentsâ€™ side, mobile device usage will be measured through data
                    collected from weekly diaries. These diaries will be completed once a week for four weeks and will include questions surrounding the amount of 
                    time a parent is engaging with their mobile device. Screenshots of mobile device usage data will also be collected through the weekly diary.
                    Through analyzing the correlation between the number of conversational turns between the child and caregiver and the prevalence of mobile device
                    usage, we aim to see understand the relationship between these variables. We hypothesize that higher levels of mobile device usage will correspond
                    to a lower quality and quantity of conversational turns</p>

            <h3>Child Development</h3>
                <div class="image-section">
                    <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the LENA Start Program and the -Dekalb Basics Program in promoting high quality and 
                    quantity language interactions in children under the age of three. We know that the more a child is exposed to an environment rich with language, the
                    more a child's brain develops. This is because environments rich with language promote more conversational turns, which are non-cry sounds made by 
                    the child after being spoken to, which will then lead to more brain development. Both programs are expected to yield a positive increase in
                    conversational turns between the child and the caregiver. Conversational turns will be measured through the usage of recorded vest that will be worn 
                    throughout the day by each child as they work through their assigned program, which will record words spoken to the child and by the child. The data
                    collected from the recorder vest will then be processed into daily data charts which are ready for analysis. Through our analysis of the conversational
                    turn done between the child and caregiver before and after the programs, we will be able to tell how effective each program was individually, and which
                    program is more effective overall.</p>
